    <p>Personality tests can have a range of benefits for professional development. It helps to prepare for the job
      interview and provides the necessary insights to make the right career choice. In addition, this can assist in
      identifying gaps or weaknesses and to seek training courses and programs to be able to operate and function better
      as required for the roles or position. </p>
    <p>
      Certain roles allow individuals to express their personality traits more than others. For example, my personality
      shows me as an introvert and is suitable for a job like a Web developer.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, with this role, some teamwork is required and some conversations with clients are necessary. Being a shy
      and introverted person, most of the time I do not speak up. I fear I might not be able to explain things properly.
      I struggle to solve problems solely by myself without asking for help from others.
    </p>
    <p>
      With this personality, I can recognize my weaknesses and discover where I need to improve. For example, I can
      engage in courses or training programs that can boost my social interaction and teamwork skills. To be better at
      meeting task deadlines, I could attend time management courses.
